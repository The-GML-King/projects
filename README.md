# Have a good time here!

Please note that all files in this repository are for **learning purposes**.
Feel free to modify, experiment, or break anything — this project is open source.

## ✨ Features
- Learning low-level programming (yes, that counts as a feature).
- I use the Win32 API in one or two files, so some parts of this repository may not be platform-friendly.
- Future experiments may appear here. Like an assembly project whenever I'm finished with C.

```c
char moral[128] = "C is acceptable, assembly is going to get me killesd.\n";
